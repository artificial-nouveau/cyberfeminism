This is an overview of books and publications that I found that were relevant
for understanding Cyberfeminism. This list will never be complete, so feel free
me to add more links.

## What is Cyberfeminism?


Mia Consalvo defines cyberfeminism as (in "Cyberfeminism", Encyclopedia of New Media, 2002):

1. a label for women—especially young women who might not even want to align with feminism's history—not just to consume new technologies but to actively participate in their making\
2. a critical engagement with new technologies and their entanglement with power structures and systemic oppression.
